# RVQuickCopy

This is a lil' automation script I made to quickly copy my GameCube ISOs to a flash drive with a single drag 'n drop :3

I uploaded it here 'cause I figured someone would find it useful

## Usage

Just drag the ISO you wish to copy over the .exe (grab it from Releases), then input the drive letter you wish to copy to!

It's meant to be used on a flash drive with the standard RVLoader file structure where the destination is just `X:/games/GCGAME/game.iso`

Oh! And if the iso you're copying over is the 2nd disc, be sure to type Y at the `Is this the 2nd disc?` prompt! Or else it would overwrite disc 1! (if you copied disc 1 first)

One last thing! Make sure the .exe is in the same folder as your source .iso! It won't work otherwise
