# RVQuickCopy

This is a lil' automation script I made to quickly copy my GameCube ISOs to a flash drive with a single drag 'n drop :3

## Usage

Just drag the ISO you wish to copy over the .exe (grab it from Releases), then input the drive letter you wish to copy to!

It's meant to be used on a flash drive with the standard RVLoader file structure where the destination is just `X:/games/GCGAME/game.iso`
